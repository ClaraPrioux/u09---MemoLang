            How does MemoLang works?

            MemoLang is based on the <strong>forgetting curve</strong>, but what
            is it? The forgetting curve is a psychological concept that
            describes how memory retention declines over time, showing that
            information is lost rapidly after learning...

        MemoLang wants to counter the forgetting curve, by reviewing the
        material at increasing intervals after the initial learning session, a
        technique known as <strong>spaced repetition</strong>. This method
        strengthens memory retention by reinforcing the information before it
        can be forgotten.
        <br />
        <br /> Limit yourself to learning no more than{" "}
        <strong>10 new words per day</strong>, while also reviewing past words,
        as consistent repetition is essentialâ€”though it requires significant
        daily effort.
